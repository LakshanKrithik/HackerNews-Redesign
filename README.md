# 🚀 HackerNews Redesign

HackerNews has been one of the most important platforms for tech enthusiasts, developers, and startup communities to share and discover the latest in technology. But let’s be honest — the UI feels outdated and uninspiring.

So, I gave it a **modern, fun, and functional** makeover. Welcome to **HackerNews Redesign** ✨
